                This chapter focuses on mockups, and I did not learn anything new. Mockups are crucial
                to bridge the gap between business and software. There are different types of mockups:
                Low Fidelity (LoFi) and High Fidelity (HiFi). There are many different ways and tools to approach
                creating mockups. It is a very iterative process.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Tangible is the word of the day today. I've been lucky enough to do some figma prototyping along with some of
                our UX designers during one of my internships, and it is an extremely valuable tool to quickly give project stakeholders
                something tangible. There is no commitment when prototyping, it's very fast, and you can do some scope creep management
                before development even starts.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">So what?</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Mockups and prototyping is absolutely worth it. Heck, usually it's required. Even if I don't turn out to be
                a UI/UX designer, knowing the processes helps me to understand the project from a designers perspective, and ask better questions
                and be a better teammate.
