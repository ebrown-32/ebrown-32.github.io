                Today I will be reflecting on Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery written by Garr Reynolds. This will focus on chapters
                2 & 4.

                Building a beautiful UI is all a process. Prototypes are a part of that process. However, to even reach the solid prototype stage
                is a detail oriented challenge. I really enjoy Chapter 2's mention of the importance of free time and rest. In my experience, this is 
                absolutely true whether I'm working on a tough programming problem or writing a paper. Sometimes going for a run or doing something
                else for a while will allow me to recharge and attack the problem with fresh ideas. I also really enjoy how Chapter 4 has backed
                up some of the things we've learned in class. For instance - starting with paper and pen can often times be more effective than jumping
                to digital tools right away.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I don't think of myself as an artist. I've always been terrible at drawing, and I recognize that other people
                are much more talented than I am when it comes to art. One thing that I really like about chapter 2 is that it points
                out that everyone has the potential for creativity. I like to think that I don't really care what other people think, I just
                know what needs to get done and I'll give it my best shot. Hopefully I keep improving.
