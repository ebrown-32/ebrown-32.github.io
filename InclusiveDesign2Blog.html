                Chapter 4 of Design of Everyday Things covers much of the stuff we've already studied,
                including conceptual models, affordances, signifiers, mappings, feedback, and constraints.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Usability is the name of the game when it comes to reinforcing the material we have already learned. Chapter
                4 references how many people have an incorrect conceptual model of the thermostat. Or how some doors are very intuitive
                but others are quite the opposite. Taking a look at the things that work well - and don't work well can be very helpful
                with UI design.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I think it's important to think about every day items that are "easy" to use. Things that are very intuitive in our every day lives
                are a great place to start when designing something digitally. I think it's also important to consider that the things in our everyday lives
                might be different for everybody, so it's important to not make any assumptions and just try to make everything as simple as 
                possible.
