                The UIUN Summit was an opportunity for us students to research a particular group of people for the purpose of determining their accessibility
                needs to design a specific website. I was tasked with researching people with trauma/PTSD, how they experience the world, and how to design a user interface
                that's inclusive to them.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Give some highlights of your population, what you learned they need, and your original recommendations. 
                1 in 6 people will experience some sort of trauma/PTSD in their lives. This population needs a user interface
                that makes them feel safe. A calming, neutral color palette is a good way to do this, along with support links
                and ways to pause and come back with their progress saved.
                <br>
                Include a narrative about how the negotiations went.
                The negotiations were interesting, because everything was very surface level. We didn't have to actually design anything
                or put any skills into action, it was just who could get words on a power point first. The assignment was designed to get people
                to consider balancing what different groups of people need, but at the end of the day a lot of the needs were similar, and for a true
                inclusive design you have to take care of everyone's needs anyway. So it seemed kind of forced.
                <br>
                I focused on fighting for support links/a support system where people with trauma/PTSD could go to voice their feedback/concerns or get
                help using the site from someone who cares. I focused on this because my requirements changed throughout the negotiations - a lot of the other
                groups called for simplicity and a neutral color palette as well, so I thought my group shared these characteristics.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">So what?</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                What were your greatest takeaways from the Summit? How will you apply them to other topics?
                I think there's an opportunity to extend this and actually build some mockups so people can realize that inclusive design
                is a lot easier said than done. Tossing up words on a powerpoint is a lot different than actually doing something. Inclusive design
                is difficult - but many people have similar needs and a good balance needs to be struck. I think it's important to test UI with a 
                variety of users and keep these considerations in mind.
