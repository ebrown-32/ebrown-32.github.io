                Explain what the UIUN Summit was and how the exercise proceeded. This is more of a logistical description; you will talk about your insights from the exercise and the details of your negotiations later. If you don't want it to sound too, "so I took this class, and we were required to...", you can call it an "Accessibility Workshop intended to get young designers thinking about UI accessibility in a new light" (or something like that).
                The UIUN Summit was an opportunity for us students to research a particular group of people for the purpose of determining their accessibility
                needs to design a specific website. I was tasked with researching people with trauma/PTSD, how they experience the world, and how to design a user interface
                that's inclusive to them.

                Give some highlights of your population, what you learned they need, and your original recommendations. 
                Many people 
                Include a narrative about how the negotiations went.
                What did you fight for?
                How did your requirements change throughout the negotiations?
                Who were your unlikely allies? Which group(s) were hardest to convince?
                How did it feel to prioritize some needs over others?
