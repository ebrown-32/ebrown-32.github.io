                Today I will be reflecting on https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/give-designers-feedback/. This article 
                is all about giving designers good feedback. If you want the finished product to turn out well, this isn't really a suggestion -- it's more of 
                a requirement.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">"Growth"</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Beyond the value to the finished product, it also benefits designers and developers because
                they sharpen their skills through feedback. As they go through the feedback loop more and more,
                they will continue to hone their craft and deliver better work.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">So what?</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                “The key to good feedback is a balance of heart and mind. I don’t care if we are talking about designers or dog walkers, the same rules of feedback apply to any type of employee. First, you have to really care. A person needs to feel that you really care about them before they’ll be receptive enough to receive your feedback, so start there. Second, put rigor and clarity into your communication so you are specific and direct about either the praise or the criticism. Most of us fail to be direct enough because it feels so risky, but that uncomfortable feeling is the sign you’re on the right track.”
–Ryan Donahue, VP, Global Design, Zendesk
