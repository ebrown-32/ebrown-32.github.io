                Today I will be reflecting on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Saz6S1svYns. This is a great
                introductory video for beginners using Figma. I think this is a worthwhile video not just for designers,
                but for developers and general hobbyists as well.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                This video might not give a comprehensive overview of all the tools in Figma, but it's sure obvious
                that you can do a ton with this tool. What I enjoy about it is the collaboration aspect. I think being able to work
                live with other people is great. Luckily, I've already had a decent amount of exposure to Figma through work.
                We have some talented UX designers who have kind have shown me the ropes and I've built a few simple prototypes
                as well. It's great to keep all stakeholders of the project connected.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I'm not good at UI/UX, but I'm trying to get better. In my mind, the only way to get truly better at something
                is to just keep practicing. The more I use Figma, the more shortcuts I learn which really speeds up my creative process.
                Basic Figma skills are such a valuable skillset to have even if you just need to communicate with UX
                designers for projects.
