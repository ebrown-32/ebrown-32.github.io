            <p class="blog-paragraph"><br>Design, price, and reliability are to products as protein, fruit, and vegetables are to the human body.
                Affordances are what we can do with things, and signifiers hint at how we use things. This chapter clearly defines an explains these
                key concepts. Beyond definitions, this section hones in on not only what makes a bad design, but how important a good design 
                is as well. However, we don't lose sight of the bigger picture - the idea that a <i>balance</i> of all considerations is key. The only 
                metric that really matters is if people enjoy using the product.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">The Door</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                Some doors are well designed, others are not. Some doors afford opening to humans and dogs (yes my basset hound knows how to open
                doors). Some doors are too confusing for even humans to open. Some lack any meaningful signifiers at all, leaving you to guess which side the
                hinge is on, or whether to push or pull. However, when buying a door you must consider the aesthetic, the functionality, the size, frequency of usage, and perhaps most importantly modern day
                - the price.

                Sure we define some nice definitions in this chapter. But to build a good product, you have to knock everything out of the park.
