                Chapter 12 of "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug focuses on the factors contributing to why users
                stay or leave a site. It argues that every user comes to a site with a certain amount of goodwill, and this can be gained
                or lost based on how your site treats them.

            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                My key takeaway from this reading is that it's important to treat users with respect. What does this mean? Respect their time by saving
                them steps. Avoid asking for unnecessary things. Design for scanability. Keep it simple.

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">So what?</h2>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">
                I think this is very consistent with other readings and things I have learned about UI design. I think everyone values simplicity and ease of use.
                It really doesn't seem like rocket science, but it's certainly much easier said than done.
